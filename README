= Super Export

* http://github.com/ihoka/radiant-super-export-extension/wikis

== DESCRIPTION:

Import/export extension for Radiant.

All records in the database are exported to individual YAML files, making it easy to manage them with a source control tool like Git or Subversion.

== FEATURES:

Default import/export path is in db/export where a directory is created for each model. Individual YAML files are saved with the record ID as their filename.

== INSTALL:

In your radiant project do:

  cd vendor/extensions
  git clone git://github.com/ihoka/radiant-super-export-extension.git super_export
  rm -rf super_export/.git
  cd ../../


== USAGE:

To export, use:
  
  $ rake db:export
  

To import, use:

  $ rake db:import


For example, exporting the Page model looks like this:

  db/
    export/
      pages/
        1.yml
        2.yml
        3.yml
        ...
